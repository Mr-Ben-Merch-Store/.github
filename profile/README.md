# What is the Mr. Ben Merch Store?

Created in 2023 in the Allen High School computer science forum, the store was built to fund the forum as a whole. It's still being built today and you can contribute 
to our website [at our github's development branch](https://github.com/Mr-Ben-Merch-Store/Website/tree/dev). 

# Steps to contribute:
Below are the steps for specific jobs you might want to cover for the store. Before you do any of these however, please
join our Discord server to stay up to date with current things (as this page might not be updated frequently).

## For product designers/graphic designers
- Be in the [Discord server](https://github.com/Mr-Ben-Merch-Store/Website/tree/dev). The current club president is: `bluerobin_`. If you have any questions feel free to ping or DM him.
- Create your design.
- Upload your design with the `/suggest` command with the design attatched in the Discord server.

## For programmers
If you need any help with any of the below steps, please contact another developer in our Discord server.

- First check the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/Mr-Ben-Merch-Store/projects/1/views/1) to see if there are any issues that you can cover.
- Because we use NextJS as our framework you need to have a basic understanding of NodeJS, Tailwind (not entirely required), and HTML (of course).
- Clone the development repository
- Edit and do your changes
- Make a pull request to the development branch
- (not required) Ask someone to review the request in the discord server if it's not being reviewed fast enough

Good luck and have fun! If you are at Allen High school please log all the hours you spend on the project and DM `bluerobin_`(the current club president) to verify your hours. (When DMing please add the commit logs/pull request with the
amount of time that you spent on that commit so that it's easier to process)

# Contribution rules
- If you are peer reviewing a pull request, please be kind while you do it
- Try your best to stick to the [project list](https://github.com/orgs/Mr-Ben-Merch-Store/projects/1/views/1) (but it's not entirely required)
